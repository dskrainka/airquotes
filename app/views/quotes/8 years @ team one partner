IDEO hires T shaped people. 
She had design research experience. 

2.5 years ago IDEO SF reorganized into individual purpose-built studios. (Design for learning, design for change)

shes a director in the food stuido (25ish designers)

studio purpose: use design to make a positive impact in food sustainable future

IDEO U: 4-6 week courses 

no such thing as a typical deliverable. 
Look through website and see case studies 

at first they were a product design company 
they became much more intangible

delvierable could be a physical product
or habit nutrition with campbell's 
uses your DNA to customize a nutritional profile just for you
helped SF school district design school lunches 

you need to figure out what you offer that fits IDEO's needs. 
You could just apply to something on the website. 

The palo alto location tends to do more health space work. They've hired folks from stanford medical. They do medical device design, etc. 

Palo Alto: The epiphany hotel light show. Project Edison. 

Because she doubts that your EE experience is. 

she offered to connect me to some people. 

writing sample 
examples of stuff you've prototyped
what's the design challenge and how'd you tackled it? 
don't go overboard
You need some kind of portfolio.
